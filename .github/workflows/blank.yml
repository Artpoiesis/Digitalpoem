  <h1>Digital Poem: In the Last Few Weeks</h1>
  <p>In the last few weeks</p>
  <p>You’ve been tormenting me incessantly,</p>
  <p>demanding from me more than I can ever give You back.</p>

  <p>Unlike Your first epiphany,</p>
  <p>this time you’ve almost killed me.</p>

  <p class="highlight fade">Cowardly, through my own hands.</p>

  <p>You’ve been hunting me for so long</p>
  <p>I’m stranger to it no more.</p>

  <p>I had always feared</p>
  <p>That state of absence of thoughts-</p>
  <p>nonetheless I was hungry for it.</p>

  <p>The ( any ) emotional confrontation -</p>
  <p>that is, public display of what grows silently inside,</p>
  <p>and ultimately hides behind -</p>
  <p>announces an inner earthquake.</p>

  <p class="highlight fade">Motus animi</p>

  <p>Now I long no more for calm sea;</p>
  <p>I see no sense in it.</p>

  <p>I desire, religiously,</p>
  <p>to acquire the ability to navigate these troubled waters.</p>

  <p>Will I ever be my own sailor?!</p>
  <p>In charge of this run-down ship?</p>

  <p>Last year I feared the landing of</p>
  <p>The pirate on shore,</p>
  <p>without realizing I had meanwhile</p>
  <p>remained viciously blind and sterile.</p>

  <p>So, before I knew ( or I could know )</p>
  <p>I fell into His cage.</p>

  <p>I’ve been desperately in pursuit</p>
  <p>of my source of light -</p>
  <p>a deadly fight for that Golden Fleece.</p>

  <p>//perhaps I should chase the dark//</p>

  <p>Without heavy chains, it’s even harder!</p>

  <p>Like a newly-freed slave</p>
  <p>without his tormenting Master,</p>
  <p>I wander amidst the fog.</p>

  <p>I scream aloud up to the sky</p>
  <p>“ Who owns Me now?!”</p>

  <p class="highlight fade">//You, it has always been You!//</p>

  <p>I always knew the answer!</p>

  <p>Now, I can rest and get back-back- back to Me.</p>
